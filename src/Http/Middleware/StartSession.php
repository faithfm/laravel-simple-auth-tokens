/**
 * Define our own StartSession class, that prevents sessions from being created when request contains 'api_token=XXXX'
 * Adapted from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29251516
 * 
 * Note: Whenever session-based middleware is triggered, Laravel will automatically start a session for the request.
 *       This is normally ok when calling from a browser (which stores cookies and retains the session next time a call
 *       is made), but when cookies are not enabled a new session will be created for every request - which can result 
 *       in thousands of sessions-files being created in the storage/framework/sessions directory.
 *       This middleware detects the presence of an 'api_token' parameter (which is typical for clients without cookies)
 *       and saves the session to an array instead of the filesystem.  (this prevents the creation of a session file)
